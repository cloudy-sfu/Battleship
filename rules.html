        <h3>1. Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective is to locate and destroy the opposing fleet before they destroy yours. The first commander to sink all 10 enemy vessels wins the match.</p>

        <h3>2. Fleet Configuration</h3>
        <p>Each party commands a fleet of <strong>10 vessels</strong> occupying a specific number of linear grid squares:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1x Battleship</strong> (Size: 4 squares)</li>
            <li><strong>2x Cruisers</strong> (Size: 3 squares)</li>
            <li><strong>3x Destroyers</strong> (Size: 2 squares)</li>
            <li><strong>4x Submarines</strong> (Size: 1 square)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Deployment Protocols</h3>
        <p>Ships are deployed on a 10x10 grid according to the following strict isolation rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear Alignment:</strong> All vessels must be placed in a straight line, oriented either <strong>vertically</strong> or <strong>horizontally</strong>. Diagonal placement of the ship hull itself is prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Isolation:</strong> No two vessels may occupy adjacent coordinates. This prohibition applies to both <strong>orthogonal</strong> (side-by-side) and <strong>diagonal</strong> adjacency.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Buffer:</strong> There must be at least one empty water grid cell separating any part of one ship from another.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Engagement Rules</h3>
        <p>The game proceeds in turns, starting with the Player.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firing:</strong> On your turn, select a coordinate on the opponent's grid to fire.</li>
            <li><strong>The "Rapid Fire" Mechanic:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hit:</strong> If a shot successfully strikes an enemy vessel, the active player retains the initiative and <strong>must fire again</strong>. This continuation applies even if the shot sinks the vessel (unless it is the final ship).</li>
                    <li><strong>Miss:</strong> If a shot lands on empty water, the turn concludes immediately, and control passes to the opponent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sinking & Area Denial:</strong> When a vessel sustains hits to all its coordinates, it is considered <strong>Sunk</strong>. Upon sinking, all grid cells immediately surrounding the sunken vessel (orthogonally and diagonally) are automatically revealed and marked as <strong>"Miss"</strong> (Gray Cross).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Victory Conditions</h3>
        <p>The match concludes immediately when a player successfully sinks the final remaining ship of the opposing fleet.</p>
